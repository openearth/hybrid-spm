# Sprint 3

Bayesian modelling
* To create a table ready for modelling, first reproject satellite data to dfm model grid
* Then, extract pixel values for all MWTL coordinates across the satellite and model data
* then, create a table of ID, time, lat, lon, MWTL_spm, dfm_spm, sat_spm

Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis 
* Run eofs with Satellite data 2015-2020  (VM, local computing runs out of memory)
* Run eofs with Satellite data 2017       (Arrange data filter)
* Run eofs analysis with different solver (Find references for solvers applicable to SPM analysis, There is not correlation with the current solver)
* Rearrange the Satellite data (mean values). The analysis might require a constant timestep (mean annual value between % and %)
