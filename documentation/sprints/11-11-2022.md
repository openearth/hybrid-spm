# Sprint 3

Bayesian modelling
* To create a table ready for modelling, first reproject satellite data to dfm model grid
* Then, extract pixel values for all MWTL coordinates across the satellite and model data
* then, create a table of ID, time, lat, lon, MWTL_spm, dfm_spm, sat_spm

Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis 
* 1.- Run eofs with Satellite data 2015-2020  (VM, local computing runs out of memory)
* 2.- Run eofs with Satellite data 2017       (Arrange data filter)
* 3.- Run eofs analysis with different solver (Find references for solvers applicable to SPM analysis, There is not correlation with the current solver)
* 4.- Rearrange the Satellite data (mean values). The analysis might require a constant timestep (mean annual value between % and %)

Outcomes EOF-Sprint session 3
* 1.- Satellite data from 2015 to 2020 has many images with gaps. The eofs tool can only handle null values if the are the same for all the images.  
* 2.- Satellite data from 2015 has many images with gaps. The eofs tool can only handle null values if the are the same for all the images.  
* 3.- Run eofs analysis with different solver. The process was run without weights. 
      The temporal pattern showed very low normalized values for January. A new run was performed without weights and witout January data. 
      A spatial pattern was recognizing matching the storm events along the year. 
* 4.- Rearrange the Satellite data (mean values). This process was not performed.

Next steps for the EOF analysis.
* 3.- Run EOF analysis with with high resolution data.
      Run EOF analysis with with high resolution data and masking outliers.
      Run EOF analysis with with high resolution data and sustituting outliers with maximun and minimun thresholds.   
 * 4.- Rearrange the Satellite data (mean monthly values) to handle null values in the images and run the EOF analysis.
