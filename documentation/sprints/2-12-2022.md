# Sprint 4

Main activities for the sprint are:
Bayesian:
Finishing the interpolation and the comparision of MWTL to satelite dataset
Starting with the bayesian modelling building and exploration
EOF:

20 december final presentation of this project. 
* keep updating the sprint log, also when working alone
* some might need some extra time to finish final products. Contact Luuk when you need to work on it several days budget wise. Working an afternoon/1day should not be a problem. Finishing products is more important then writing in report. Luuk will contact everybody for data input for the presentation.

For the bayesian modelling:
* currently we have finished the interpolation for the 100m DFM output. On windows the interpolation was creating gaps, causing less points to match with the MWTL dataset. When running on linux, we currently found more matches.
* finished the comparision of MWTL dataset with the new interpolated CMS dataset. The CMS data has been aggregated by month, so we could find more matches between MWTL and CMS 
* input for bayesian model has been made -> date, coords, SPM mwtl, SPM sat and SPM DFM.This can also be something we talk about in the presentation? 
* exploration of bayesian has started, task for next time is to get it up and running. Currently there are still errors. 

EOF outcomes:
* The EOF anlysis has been done for the firts modelled SPM product (1000x1000m resolution and without removing outliers). The outputs of this analysis produced a temporal patter with a anomality in the month of January. Removing the Janauary data created a temporal pattern likely sincronized with the storm season during 2017.
* The EOF analysis has been performed with the modelled second SPM product (100x100m resolution and without removing outliers). Some corrections in the new dataset were required 1)removing 'layer' dimmension with the .sel(layer=-8, method ='nearest'), and sorting time data with .sortby('time') method. The outcomes of the analysis in time and space were the same that previous analysis. 


EOF next steps:
* Producing the EOF analysis for a third modelled SPM product (100x100m resolution setting maximun and minimun values for SPM). 30-minutes on Monday.
* Producing the EOF analysis for a second satellite-derived SPM product (gap-filled). 30-minutes on Monday.
* Evaluating new solvers and EOF methods with first modelled SPM product (removing January data). 1 hour on Friday.
* Evaluating new solvers and EOF methods with third modelled SPM product. 1-hour on Monday.
