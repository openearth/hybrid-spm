# Sprint 4

Main activities for the sprint are:
Bayesian:
Finishing the interpolation and the comparision of MWTL to satelite dataset
Starting with the bayesian modelling building and exploration
EOF:

20 december final presentation of this project. 
* keep updating the sprint log, also when working alone
* some might need some extra time to finish final products. Finishing products is more important then writing in report. Luuk will contact everybody for data input for the presentation.

For the bayesian modelling:
* currently we have finished the interpolation for the old DFM dataset (400 m). When the whole process works, we will do it for the new DFM (100 m)
* finished the comparision of MWTL dataset with the new interpolated CMS dataset. The CMS data has been aggregated by month, so we could find more matches between MWTL and CMS 
* exploration of bayesian
