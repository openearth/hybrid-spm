# Sprint 2

1. Exploring fusion methodologies
2. Data pre-processing and EOF

For 1.
* Fusion methodologies were presented according to requirements, performance and ease of implementation
* Caveat of these fusion methodologies is requiring good reference (and suffient) datasets
* Bayesian (ensemble averaging) presents itself as most promising due to uncertainties being captured and also less of a 'black box' versus other machine learning methods. Task for today is to find other work that implemented bayesian in a simplistic manner that we can adapt for our purpose, with possibility to improve the deterministic outcome of SPM

For implementation of Bayesian modelling, the following steps need to take place:
* All the data will need to be consolidated in a tabular format.
* For this to happen, both the MWTL and Satellite data need to be reprojected onto the grid of the DFM model output.
* For every MWTL location, the SPM value is extracted from model and satellite.

For 2.
* EOF implementation found that is very straightforward to implement
* Model needs to be explored for potential outliers (and if so, what threshold value), as well as checking artifacts and ways to mask those
* Task for today to implement EOF on the model output (and if successful, then the satellite too). First thresholds or cleaning steps to be performed today for model and satellite data.
