# Sprint 1

Main activities identified are:
1. Exploring fusion methodologies
2. Extracting spatio-temporal patterns from available datasets to gap-fill (data cleaning/preparation)

To achieve a generalised fused product, good spatio-temporal variation with the input data must be achieved (as well as reference dataset). This is largely achieved through the data preparation stage, of which the following considerations must be taken into account:
* To include the spatial and temporal dimension, the time points for each dataset must be known. For the model data, daily averages from the unstructured mesh are interpolated onto a structured grid. To-do: visual check on the interpolation; export data in 10-min timeseries; export data for the 10-11am UTC hourly average to harmonise with satellite data
* (Nice-have): For the satellite data, perhaps images that coincide with the low tidal cycles can be removed, and EOF or gap filling can be done on the remaining images. Images that coincide with low tidal cycles risk more flats being exposed and could also be confused for wet/dry pixels.

For 1:
* Main spatio-temporal fusion methodologies such as Bayesian, Gaussian-averaging and 4DVarNet were explored
* All methodologies share some common needs: sufficient spatio-temporally varying data for training/calibration
* Two caveats emerge: A successfully fused product will require sufficiently spatially and temporally varying input data
* At the moment, MWTL data is almost one dimension (varies in time but not in space)
* At the moment, satellite data has no sensing time in the metadata. However, based on the archive of Sentinel-2A and 2B data, typical sensing times are between 10-11am UTC. An average of 10:30am UTC is taken as an assumption, with uncertainty of +/-30 min
