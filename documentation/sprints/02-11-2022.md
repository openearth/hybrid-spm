# Sprint 1

Main activities identified are:
1. Exploring fusion methodologies
2. Extracting spatio-temporal patterns from available datasets to gap-fill

For 1:
* Main spatio-temporal fusion methodologies such as Bayesian, Gaussian-averaging and 4DVarNet were explored
* All methodologies share some common needs: sufficient spatio-temporally varying data for training/calibration
* Two caveats emerge: A successfully fused product will require sufficiently spatially and temporally varying input data
* At the moment, MWTL data is almost one dimension (varies in time but not in space)
* At the moment, satellite data has no sensing time in the metadata. This needs to be rectified so that tidal component is taken into account in the underlying fusion model.

For 2:
